Welcome! 

I am a macroeconomist with interests in international finance and information economics.

Next Fall, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Economics of [SciencesPo](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html).

In Fall 2021, I will join [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/) as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics.

I obtained my PhD in 2020 from [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics) and I am a member of the [Centre for Macroeconomics](http://www.centreformacroeconomics.ac.uk/Home.aspx).
